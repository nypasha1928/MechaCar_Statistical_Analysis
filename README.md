# Multiple Linear Regression to Predict MPG

#### This simple had a dependent variable of (mpg) and five other independent variables (vehicle_length,vehicle_weight,spoiler_angle,ground_clearance,AWD). Since there was no feature selection in this model we will see that some variables are less relevant to include in the model.

For the overall model, we see that we have a R-squared of .7149 which mean that this model with our given dataset, our five independent varibles can explain about 70% of what determines (mpg). Which in general, is a satisfactory model to use. This model can be improved by simply including more effective varibles to explain our dependent varible (mpg) through data collection.

No, our model does not have a slope of zero since the relationship between our Y and our intercept does not equal zero. Our alternative hypothesis says that our intercept does not equal zero which is true.

### Independent Variable Analysis:

    1. vehicle_length
         P-value of about 0 shows that it is statistically significant in this model.
    2. vehicle_weight  
         P-value of .0776 shows that it is statistically significant to include in this model only at the .1 alpha level.
    3. spoiler_angle  
         P-value of .3069 shows that it is not statistically significant at any alpha level. Therefore not worth to include in this model.
    4. ground_clearance
         P-value of .3069 shows that it is not statistically significant at any alpha level. Therefore not worth to include in this model.
    5. AWD   
         P-value of .1852 shows that it is not statistically significant at any alpha level.
